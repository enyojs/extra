## Enyo Extra Library

Extra is a library for Enyo 2.  This mainly consists of code that doesn't fit into Enyo
core, but is useful for the various projects we're supporting. If we were doing
this over, most of this would be its own repos.

* analyzer2 - an updated JS code analysis library used by both api-tool and ares
* youtube - a enyo.Control that handles embedding of YouTube videos
* test - a Enyo testing library; a minified version is used for the Enyo core and ajax tests
